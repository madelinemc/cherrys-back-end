# Cherry's - Back-End

## About:
Cherry's was created for Flatiron School's phase 4 project as a playful and interactive way to build and place an order for an ice cream treat. It was made with a Javascript front-end and Rails API back-end. 

## Software Used:
* Ruby on Rails as an API
* Active Record
* Postgres database
* JavaScript
* JavaScript Drag and Drop API

## Installation:
1. Fork and clone this repo onto your local machine and change into the directory

2. In your terminal run: 
```$ bundle install```

3. To create the database and populate the app with ice cream flavors, toppings, and base options, run: 
```$ rails db:migrate```
```$ rails db:seed```

4. To set up the server run: 
```$ rails s```
    
5. Before you can place your ice cream order, you'll have to get the front-end set up too: [Cherry's - Front-End](https://github.com/madelinemc/cherrys-front-end) üç¶
